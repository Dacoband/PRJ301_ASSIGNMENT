# PRJ301_ASSIGNMENT
Now Using MCV2 Model <br>
Remember that this is MCV2 structure which requires you to link back to page CentralController to switch between pages. The ways can use is set attribute, session tracking, "hidden" input, form with POST method. DO NOT use a href as it will give away your parameter on the addressbar (lost the anominity security)
Please use your own branch to work on your function tasks. Do Not use MAIN BRANCH, as it will be the final project to submit. <br>
If you need help on your task, text me and show me your branch so I can test your case of errors.
